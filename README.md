# Grey Tweaks

This is a minecraft mod for implementing quick and dirty feature changes to my private vanilla SMP world. All of the mods are server side and are not needed on the client.

## Features

* undead mobs spawn with "roguelike" gear
* Stone Bricks randomly decay into their crumbled variants over time
* Cats only spawn in villages with 4 or more fishermen
* Villagers can no longer summon iron golems
* Ice melts in warm biomes
* Snow accumulates according to surrounding blocks
* Ice and snow instantly melt on chunk load during config:summer
* Cherry trees spawn pink petals nearby
* Resin appears on pale oak logs
* Bees cause small flowers to spread sometimes
* Elytra flight only allowed in the end (disabled by default)
* Passive mobs gradually regenerate health
* Wandering trader offers include elytra and shulker shells
